## Install TailwindCSS

Depending on your project, steps to install Tailwind may vary.
Check out [their installation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for guidance.

## Install Required Dependencies

```bash
npm install react-aria-components class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate
```

This project requires the following packages:

- [React Aria Components](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/react-aria-components)
- [Class Variance Authority](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva)
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
- [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge)
- [tailwindcss-animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate)

## Install Icons

Draft UI uses [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) by default. You can use whichever library you prefer, but
you'll need to replace the default icons manually.

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

## Configure Path Aliases

Draft UI uses the path alias <code>@/\*</code> by default. If you
want to use a different alias, you&apos;ll need to update your
components manually.

```json {3-6} title="tsconfig.json"
...
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
...
```

## Configure Tailwind

Make sure to include the <code>tailwindcss-animate</code> plugin

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ['class'],
  content: ['app/**/*.{ts,tsx}', 'components/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  plugins: [require('tailwindcss-animate')],
}
```

## Add a `cn` helper function

Developed by [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com), this function combines two useful libraries that makes working
with Tailwind much easier. It is used heavily with the Draft UI
components.

```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx'
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

## All Done!

Now your ready to start building your application!
