## Examples

<Callout type="note">
  Althought similar to **`Meter`**, **`ProgressBar`** is used to represent
  progress. In other words, it would typically be used in circumstances that
  start at zero and tend toward completion. For example: Loading progress,
  download progress, or battery charge progress.
</Callout>

### Default

This is the default **`ProgressBar`**
