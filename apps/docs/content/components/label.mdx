<Callout type="important">
  **`Label`** is a primitive component, it is not meant to be used on it's own.
  Many components that behave as form inputs automatically handle linking labels
  to their respective inputs, such as **`DatePicker`**, **`RadioGroup`**,
  **`Select`**, **`TextField`**, **`Switch`**, etc.
